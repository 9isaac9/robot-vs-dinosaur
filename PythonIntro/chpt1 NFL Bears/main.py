# NFL Teams
# a. Declare a variable to store an NFL team name. Use the built-in Python input()
# function to retrieve a user’s inputted favorite NFL team.
# b. Build out a conditional for “Bears”, in which if selected it will print to the console
# “Quarterback much?”
# c. Build out a conditional for “Vikings”, in which if selected it will print to the
# console “Loud noises!”
# d. Build out a conditional for “Lions”, in which if selected it will print to the console
# “LOL! They bad!”
# e. Build out a conditional for “Packers” in which if selected it will print to the
# console “Best team in the world! Actually, the universe!”
# f. Build out a “default” conditional to print to the console “Pick a different team” in
# the scenario where a user doesn’t input “Bears”, “Vikings”, “Lions”, or “Packers”.
